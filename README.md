# 2HDM-Vmin
This package contains a Mathematica interface and some c++ code.
Open parameter-setting.nb in Mathematica and run each cell sequentially.
It will guide you through these steps:
1. generate the samples, e.g. setting various scalar masses...
2. output them to c++
3. compile the c++ source code (only if the GNU g++ compiler has been installed, otherwise you have to compile it by hand)
4. run the c++ code (more exactly, the executable binary)
5. import the result back to Mathematica,
6. make a plot
